# hillclimb
Hill Climbing is a simple optimization algorithm used in Artificial Intelligence. It starts with a random solution and then tries to improve it step by step by moving towards a better neighbor. If a neighbor is better, the algorithm “climbs the hill” (moves there). If no better neighbor is found, it stops.
